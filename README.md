## Course Overview

**Instructor**: Dr. Trenton W. Ford  
**Time**: Tuesdays & Thursdays, 11:00 AM – 12:20 PM  
**Location**: ISC 3291  
**Office Hours**: Mondays, 8:00 AM – 10:00 AM, or by appointment

**Course Description**:

This course will focus on the application of machine learning algorithms, their nature, and the technical considerations involved. Topics include:

- Introductory data engineering
- Linear regression, decision trees, and random forests
- SVMs, KNN, clustering techniques
- Association rules, natural language processing
- Neural networks and dimensionality reduction

The emphasis will be on the practical coding and implementation of these algorithms.

Lecture slides, notes, and in-class coding examples will be uploaded after each lecture. The following folders contain resources sorted by week:

- **[Week 1](lectures/week1/)**: Introduction, HPC Resources, Linux Basics
- **[Week 2](lectures/week2/)**: Data Processing Fundamentals, File Transfer Techniques
- **[Week 3](lectures/week3/)**: OLS, ML, and Polynomial Regression
- **[Week 4](lectures/week4/)**: Decision Trees and Support Vector Regression
- **[Week 5](lectures/week5/)**: Classification Techniques

Refer to the [lectures](lectures/) directory for weekly lecture notes, and keep an eye on the repository for updates.

## Final Project Guidelines

The final project is a significant component of this course (40% of your grade) and will include:

1. **Project Proposal**: Due October 24th. Submit a proposal for your chosen topic.
2. **Project Submission**: Due December 6th by 11:59 PM. Conduct a data analysis within your domain of study, applying machine learning algorithms learned during the semester.
3. **Presentation**: On December 5th, you will present your project in a poster format.

Detailed project guidelines and rubrics are available in the [final-project](final-project/) directory.
